# a new Dom renderer

This framework aims to minimize the retrieval and rendering times by solely relying on javascript to render the Dom.
Html is only used to establish a minimal page.
JS is also used to style the elements.

## V3
base files: indexNV3.html azulstartV3.js and azulLibNV3.js

tested using addElement to add button. addButton will be redundant

## V4
base files: indexNV4.html azulstartV4.js and azulLibNV4.js

objective is to use fetch to retrieve js files after rendering the page

 1. addListeners after rendering the www page
 2. test extending objects with methods
 3. test minimizing js code
